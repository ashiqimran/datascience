# Improving performance of wine dataset
Task 1
Use one classification method on the dataset "wine.csv". You can apply any of the methods explained in this instruction notebook or any other method in scikit-learn. You can even implement your own method. You can tune your model by using any combination of parameter values. Use 75% of the data for training and the rest for testing. Print out the accuracy of the model in Task 1. Print out the confusion matrix for the model in Task 1.

Task 2
Use the same model with the same parameters you have chosen in Task 1. However, instead of using 75%/25% train/test split, apply 10-fold stratified cross-validation. Print out the accuracy of each fold. Print out the average accuracy across all the folds.
